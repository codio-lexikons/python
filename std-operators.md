#Arithmetic Operators
Assume variable `a` holds 10 and variable `b` holds 20, then:

| Operator |	Description	| Example |
|-|-|-|
| +|	Addition - Adds values on either side of the operator |	a + b will give 30
| -	|Subtraction - Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand |	a - b will give -10
| *	| Multiplication - Multiplies values on either side of the operator	| a * b will give 200
|/	|Division - Divides left hand operand by right hand operand	| b / a will give 2
|%| Modulus - Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder	|b % a will give 0
|**|	Exponent - Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators|	a**b will give 10 to the power 20
|//|	Floor Division - The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed.	| 9//2 is equal to 4 and 9.0//2.0 is equal to 4.0
