#Comparison Operators
Assume variable `a` holds `10` and variable `b` holds `20`, then:

| Operator |	Description	| Example |
|-|-|-|
|==|	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.	|(a == b) is not true.
|!=|	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.|	(a != b) is true.
|<>|	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.|	(a <> b) is true. This is similar to != operator.
|>|	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.|	(a > b) is not true.
|<|Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.|	(a < b) is true.
|>=|	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	|(a >= b) is not true.
|<=|	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	|(a <= b) is true.
